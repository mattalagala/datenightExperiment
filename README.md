# datenight

#I decided to make a separate repository for what I've done because I had to make a lot of changes to the HTML files for the search functionality to work. 

I also added the 'Granim.js' (Gradient Animation) up top, in order for that to work I had to change the 'DATE NIGHT' h2 tag and make it into a picture. 

Also I had to add a few lines of code to both Wiley's and Adeel's code. The items on lines 10 & 11, clears the container before it runs the third button (Wine & Dine). 

Also, the title for the meal and drink containers now show what category you chose. 

So basically the project as is covers all our Phase 1 project requirements, after you guys agree with all the changes and merge it to the master brance of DateNight. 

Tomorrow if I have time I will work on adding a dropdown so that it lists all the category options instead of typing it in. 

Please review and let me know.
